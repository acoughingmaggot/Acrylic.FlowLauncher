## 🛠 How to Use

1. Download the .xaml file, and save it to the desktop, or any memorable folder on your pc. Right click the file, and copy, as we will need it later on.
2.  Open Flow Launcher using the shortcut customized to open the search bar (by default, it is alt + space).
3. Type Flow Launcher UserData Folder and press enter on your keyboard.
4. A File Explorer window should then open. Open the Themes folder.
5. Paste the WinUi 3.xaml file you copied earlier.
6. Restart the flow launcher and enjoy the new look!

## 💡 Notes

This theme was designed with WinUI 3 in mind. It’s perfect for users who like modern, consistent setups.
