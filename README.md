## ðŸ›  How to Use

1. Download the WinUI 3.xaml file above, and save it to the desktop, or any other easily accessible folder on your pc. Right click the file, and copy, as we will need it later on.
2. Open Flow Launcher using the shortcut customized to open the search bar (by default, it is alt + space).
3. Type Flow Launcher UserData Folder and press enter on your keyboard.
4. A File Explorer window should then open. Open the Themes folder.
5. Paste the WinUI 3.xaml file you copied earlier.
6. Restart the flow launcher and enjoy the new look!

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

This theme was designed with WinUI 3 in mind. Bear in mind, it is also my personal theme, so if you donâ€™t agree with any of my design choices, feel free to adjust it to your liking, but please understand that these choices reflect my personal preferences. This is also my first Flow Launcher theme, so any suggestions or feedback are welcome!
